# JS Animation
This project demonstrates an interactive and animated landing page for an iPhone product, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and ScrollTrigger to create scroll-based animations, highlighting product features and providing a visually dynamic user experience.
